## Program Description

My project is a platform game where a cat must pass the level wihout loosing all lives. 
The cat must jump and move forward while avoiding obstacles and enemies.
The goal of the program is to provide a simple game that works smoothly with the player's input and
without errors that would ruin the gaming experience. The program will let the user know if they
have lost the game or not.
